# DTH-System

Implementing a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) System for Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Key-Value Storage.
I.	INTRODUCTION
Implementing a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) System for Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Key-Value Storage involves creating a decentralized infrastructure where nodes collectively manage key-value pairs. Each node is responsible for a specific range of keys, and the system ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient key retrieval across the network.

Key Features of DHTs:
1.	Scalability: DHTs can handle large amounts of data and can seamlessly scale to accommodate more nodes without significant performance overhead.
2.	Fault Tolerance: DHTs are resilient to node failures, as each node only stores a subset of the data. If a node fails, the data it holds can be replicated on other nodes, ensuring data availability.
3.	Decentralization: DHTs operate without a central authority, eliminating single points of failure and promoting distributed control.
Components of a DHT System:
1.	Nodes: The building blocks of a DHT, each node stores a portion of the data and participates in the lookup and data routing process.
2.	Hash Function: A consistent hashing function maps keys to positions in the DHT's identifier space, ensuring that similar keys are stored on nearby nodes.
3.	Overlay Network: A logical network formed by the connections between nodes, enabling routing and communication between nodes.
4.	Data Storage: Each node stores a subset of the key-value pairs based on its position in the identifier space.
5.	Lookup and Routing: When a node receives a lookup request for a key, it determines the responsible node based on the hash function and routes the request accordingly.
Applications of DHTs:
1.	Distributed File Systems: DHTs provide a scalable infrastructure for storing and managing large distributed files.
2.	Peer-to-Peer Networks: DHTs enable efficient data sharing and content distribution in peer-to-peer networks.
3.	Caching Systems: DHTs can be used to implement distributed caching systems for efficient data retrieval.
4.	Distributed Databases: DHTs can serve as the underlying storage mechanism for distributed databases.
5.	Domain Name Services: DHTs can be used to implement decentralized domain name systems.

III.	IMPLEMENTATION
1.  Node Class: 
   - Represents a node in the Chord DHT.
   - Stores a unique identifier, a key-value data store, and a finger table for efficient key lookup.
2.  ChordRing Class: 
   - Represents the Chord ring and manages the addition of nodes.
   - Defines a method to hash string keys into numerical identifiers.
   - Implements a method to find the node responsible for a given key using the Chord protocol.
3.  Main Function: 
   - Creates a Chord ring.
   - Creates two nodes with hashed identifiers based on string keys ("node1" and "node2").
   - Adds nodes to the Chord ring.
   - Finds and prints the nodes responsible for keys "key1" and "key2" in the Chord ring.

Approach:
1.  Node Responsibility: 
   - Each node is responsible for a certain range of keys based on its identifier in the Chord ring.
2.  Key Lookup: 
   - Nodes use the Chord protocol to efficiently locate the node responsible for a given key.
   - The `find_node` method in the ChordRing class performs this key lookup.
3.  Hashing: 
   - Keys are hashed using SHA-1 to obtain numerical identifiers.
   - Nodes are sorted based on their identifiers to maintain a consistent order in the Chord ring.
4.  Adding Nodes: 
   - Nodes are added to the Chord ring, and their identifiers determine their position in the ring.
   - The Chord protocol is used to establish finger tables for efficient key routing.
5.  Print Node Responsibility: 
   - Demonstrates how to find the nodes responsible for specific keys in the Chord ring.

                return self.finger_table[i]
        return self  # If no closer node is found in the finger table, return this node

    def in_range(self, target, start, end):
        # Check if a target identifier is within a specified range
        if start <= end:

    def hash_key(self, key):
        # Hash a string key to get a numerical identifier
        return int(hashlib.sha1(key.encode()).hexdigest(), 16)

    def find_node(self, key):
        # Find the node responsible for a given key in the Chord ring
        hashed_key = self.hash_key(key)
        with self.lock:
            index = bisect.bisect_left([node.identifier for node in self.nodes], hashed_key) % len(self.nodes)
            return self.nodes[index]

def main():
    # Create a Chord ring
    ring = ChordRing()

    # Create nodes and add them to the ring
    node1 = Node(ring.hash_key("node1"))
    node2 = Node(ring.hash_key("node2"))
    ring.add_node(node1)
    ring.add_node(node2)

    # Find and print the nodes responsible for 'key1' and 'key2'
    print("Node responsible for 'key1':", ring.find_node("key1").identifier)
    print("Node responsible for 'key2':", ring.find_node("key2").identifier)
